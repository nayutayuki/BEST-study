# BMM and ICM Training Code

## Project Description
EfficientNetV2 is an optimized version, which has smaller parameters than EfficientNet, better parameter efficiency, and faster training speed. In this study, EfficientNetV2 was used to develop two binary classification models:

- **BMM Model:** Distinguishes benign and malignant lesions.
- **ICM Model:** Distinguishes invasive carcinoma from carcinoma in situ.

The training process for both models is the same. Breast ultrasound images were obtained from 5 hospitals, using a total of 2,851 ultrasound images for BMM (1,043 benign and 1,808 malignant) and 1,808 malignant ultrasound images for ICM (444 carcinoma in situ and 1,364 invasive carcinoma). The data was divided into training, validation, and test sets in a ratio of 7:2:1. Images were preprocessed into 3×299×299, and data augmentation was performed.

The training process was 300 epochs, with a learning rate of 0.001, a weight decay rate of 0.0005, and a small batch size of 8. Dropout was applied to the last fully connected layer of the second subnet, and the drop probability was set to 0.5 to alleviate overfitting.
